# Homework 0: Turning in assignments

This homework is a test run for submitting the future homework assignments
for this class. You will test whether everything is working as expected by
submitting this assignment to the Gradescope. Same method should be followed
throughout the course for the submission of the assignments.

**This assignment is a practice to make sure that each student is comfortable with:**
   * Cloning a clean copy of your assignment from the GitHub repository using
   SSH and not by typing a password (the repository link
   will be of the format
   `git@github.com:ckanich-classrooms/cs361-hw0-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.git`)
   * Making a change, committing it, and pushing it (over ssh only,avoid password typing).
   * Navigating to the course Gradescope page and uploading those
      changes (this upload goes through GitHub, not from the machine where
      you are doing your programming).

Before accepting this assignment, make sure your SSH keys
are working and added to your GitHub account. Go to the [this GitHub Classroom
assignment]({{page.github_link}}) and accept the invite. The task
is a super simple **"write a program that returns 42"**. 
For evaluation, you need to complete the process starting from setting up SSH keys
for GITHUB, writing program, commiting and pushing it to the GitHub till submitting it in via
Gradescope. 
All course assignments are visible from the [course Gradescope page]({{site.gradescope}}).

If you have had any issues getting your programming environment set
up, now is the time to get some help on that, either from the TAs during the office hours
or posting on [Piazza]({{site.discussion}}). 

## Grading
Grading will be done automatically using Gradescope. Committing to
GitHub is not sufficient - your code must be submitted to Gradescope. If
you have issues with the autograder, please contact us via Piazza ASAP.
**Please keep in mind that technical issues while submitting your assignment is not an
acceptable excuse for improper or late submissions.**

## Points
This assignment has **0 points**. The autograder points are shown for demonstration.

## Due Date
This assignment is due {{ page.due.date | date: "%s" | date: site.datetimeformat }}. See the
[syllabus](syllabus.html) for the late turnin policy.
