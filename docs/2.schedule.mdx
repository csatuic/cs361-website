All readings are from Computer Systems, a programmer’s perspective, by Randal E. Bryant and David R.
O’Hallaron unless otherwise stated.

This semester, the intended flow of a week of class is this:

*  Throughout the week: there will be assigned readings and video lectures.
*  Mondays: there is a synchronous, online, required lab session with a short activity and a
   Gradescope quiz based on that activity **due on that day at 5pm**. Check your schedule for the
   time of your lab session; the lab will take place via Blackboard Collaborate.
*  Tuesdays: open Q&A office hours in Zoom.
   Newly recorded video lectures for the week premiere. I will keep them in
   [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhy9gU5W1fvVYcQUBZvS2wMcgsPnkQbJu). **On weeks with exams**, we will
   do discussion questions during class on Tuesday, but it won't count toward
   your participation grade.
*  Thursdays: Content quizzes and discussion quizzes **are due at 12:30pm**. Class (delivered via
   Zoom and YouTube) using Poll Everywhere for interactive exercises. **On weeks with
   exams**, we have the exam during class instead.

All assignment turnins are through the course gradescope page.

If I find or mention additional useful videos & web resources I'll add them to [this
google
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18yzSKrb-nhL_CrJ7BHqOJPN5DobB9jnDvnFG2j3k0g8/edit)
(UIC login required). Anyone can edit it so feel free to add resources you feel are helpful.
