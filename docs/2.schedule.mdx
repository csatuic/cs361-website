All readings are from Computer Systems, a programmer’s perspective, by Randal E. Bryant and David R.
O’Hallaron unless otherwise stated.

This semester, the intended flow of a week of class is this:

*  Mondays: there is a synchronous, in-person, required lab session with a short
activity and a Gradescope quiz based on that activity **due on that day at
5pm**. Check your schedule for the time of your lab session; the labs will take
place in SEL 2254.

*  Tuesdays/Thursdays: there will be assigned readings and in-person lectures. There will also be
short iclicker quizzes that count towards your class participation.
   **On weeks with exams**, we have the exam during class instead.

All assignment turnins are through the course Gradescope page.
