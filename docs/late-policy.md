Every assignment in this course is due at exactly the time stated on Gradescope, and while we will
grade late assignments, they earn zero credit.

Gradescope deadlines are *precise* - an assignment is late if it was turned in one millisecond or
one month late.

Gradescope deadlines are *universal* - you must turn in your code, and it doesn't matter whether you
didn't turn it in because it wasn't compiling, or couldn't upload it to git, or couldn't upload it
to gradescope. You can turn in homework assignments an unlimited number of times, so we recommend
that you turn them in early and often.

Because these deadlines are so rigid, by default we will not include your lowest exam, your lowest
homework, and your two lowest lab, discussion, and quiz scores in your final grade for the class.
The later assignments and exams in the course are more difficult than the earlier ones, and there is
no exceptional late policy - we recommend that you do not use these unless you genuinely need to, so
that they're available if unexpected issues come up.

If your lowest exam and/or lowest homework grades are higher than your course average, we will
include them in the calculation of your final grade. This means that your lowest exam and lowest
homework can't *hurt* your final grade, they can only help it, so it will  always be worth it to
complete every assignment.
