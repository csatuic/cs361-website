# Lab 7: Pointers & Arrays 

This lab is meant to be a refresher on C pointers and arrays to prepare you for homework 4
and help you finish homework 3.  

For the first half of the lab, you need to work on your own and complete Lab 7's assignment on [Gradescope]({{site.gradescope}}).
**You should not need to execute the provided example code to find the answers.**
For the second half, you will discuss the answers with your peer and perform the evaluation.

The main activities for this lab are:
1. Answer the questions on Gradescope.
2. Discuss the answers with your peer. You can find your pairings for the lab in [this sheet]({{page.pairings}}).
3. After discussion, please grade your peers out of **1 point** using [this form]({{site.eval_link}}).

## Peer evaluation rubric

If your grader isn't in lab, contact the TA and they
will either pair you up with someone else or evaluate you. If the person you are in charge of
grading isn't in the lab, you can evaluate a TA.

You can **only** evaluate/be evaluated by the person who you are assigned, **or** someone that the
TA has designated. Anyone who submits an evaluation besides this will receive a zero for the lab.
